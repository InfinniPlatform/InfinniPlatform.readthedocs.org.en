BLOB Storage
============

BLOB storage service can be used to store and retrieve Binary Large Objects (BLOBs), or what are more commonly known as files. In this part we will

There are many reasons why you should consider using BLOB storage. Perhaps you want to share files with clients, or off-load some of the static
content from your web servers to reduce the load on them.
