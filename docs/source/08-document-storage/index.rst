Document Storage
================

**Document storage** is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured
data. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL_ databases, and the popularity of the term *document-oriented database* has
grown with the use of the term NoSQL itself.

InfinniPlatform provides abstraction layer to work with a document-oriented database and its implementation based on MongoDB_.
