Application Events
==================

Any application may require initialization at the start and deinitialization in the end of app execution. First this implies that app may have
pre-defined settings, for instance allocation of particular resources, data migration, cache pre-filling and so on. Second, at the stage of
deinitialization, a reverse process take place, that is disposing allocated resources. Both stages are optional and depend on app logic and
resources it manipulates.


Application Events Types
------------------------

InfinniPlatfrom apps may handle the following events:

* Before app services launch
* After app services launch
* Before app services stop
* After app services stop

Event **before launch** :doc:`app services </07-services/index>` lets creation of configurable actions before app will start to respond the queries.
This event handlers define a mandatory stage for successful app launch. For example, to perform data migration.

Event **after launch** :doc:`app services </07-services/index>` lets to run optional background tasks at the app start. For example, :doc:`cache </11-cache/index>`
pre-filling with data set or perform indexing can be done at this stage.

Event **before stop** :doc:`app services </07-services/index>` lets to handle query to stop the app. For example, an :doc:`app log </05-logging/index>`
record action can be initiated and inform other cluster nodes about this event to prepare app for shutdown.

Event **after stop** :doc:`app services </07-services/index>` lets to handle the moment when app stops responding. This type event handlers practically
command and then manage to correctly shutdown the app. You may dispose resources, save data retaining in memory and :doc:`inform </12-queues/index>`
other cluster's nodes about this event.

.. note:: You should pay attention that application may stop by exception or forcefully unloaded by administrative tools. Don't rely that aforementioned
          event handlers will be invoked anyway. Instead of this the **restoration logic** should be implemented to help handle those emergencies.

.. index:: IApplicationEventHandler
.. index:: IApplicationEventHandler.OnBeforeStart()
.. index:: IApplicationEventHandler.OnAfterStart()
.. index:: IApplicationEventHandler.OnBeforeStop()
.. index:: IApplicationEventHandler.OnAfterStop()

Application Event Handler
-------------------------

To write an event handler to implement ``InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.IApplicationEventHandler`` interface and :doc:`register </02-ioc/container-builder>`
its implementation in :doc:`IoC-container module </02-ioc/container-module>`. However the most simple way is to inherit the event handler from the
abstract class ``InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.ApplicationEventHandler`` and override the most applicable methods.

Interface ``InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.IApplicationEventHandler`` describes methods of handling for each event type:

* ``OnBeforeStart()`` - to handle events before app launch
* ``OnAfterStart()`` - to handle events after app launch
* ``OnBeforeStop()`` - to handle events before app stop
* ``OnAfterStop()`` - to handle events after app stop 

Next example shows a handler which handles an event before app launch.

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3,12

    public class MyApplicationEventHandler : InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.ApplicationEventHandler
    {
        public override void OnBeforeStart()
        {
            // App initialization code
        }
    }

    // ...

    builder.RegisterType<MyApplicationEventHandler>()
           .As<InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.IApplicationEventHandler>()
           .SingleInstance();


Asynchronous Event Handling
---------------------------

All methods defined in the ``InfinniPlatform.Sdk.Hosting.IApplicationEventHandler`` interface are called synchronously that is they don't return result
until completed. Exceptions may occur in those methods are recorded in app log. Such behavior is intentionally predefined so the app could control
the launch-stop-launch transitions on its own.

In the case when status of event handling is unnecessary you may enclose event handling in ``try/catch`` block, nevertheless it is highly recommended
to recorded exception into :doc:`app log </05-logging/index>`. If part of logics can be executed asynchronously it is recommended to run it in a new
thread.

:ref:`You can see below <app-events>` listed a number of recommended ways to handle events depending on its type. For example, method code ``OnBeforeStart()``
must be synchronous and execute mandatory actions before app launch. Method code ``OnAfterStart()`` must be asynchronous and not treat an exception as
emergency, in addition to that, execute optional actions.

.. note:: It is the good practice when you minimize execution time of ``OnBeforeStart()`` Ð¸ ``OnAfterStop()``, so that can help to reduce launch and
          stop time. Accordingly this will improve the speed of app deployment and its re-launch.

You can view an example below of asynchronous event handling ``OnAfterStart()`` using method `Task.Run()`_.

    {

        {
            Task.Run(() =>
                     {
                         try
                         {
                             // Initialize app code
                         }
                         catch (Exception exception)
                         {
                             // Record exception into log
                         }
                     });
        }
    }
